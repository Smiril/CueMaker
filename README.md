# CueMaker

CueMaker scans directories and creates .cue files for .bin files that are missing them. 
This is in response to RetroPie requiring the .cue file for psx games. There are some existing applications, 
however they require you to do each file individually.

This project consists of two applications. A python script that should run on 2.x or 3.x and a .Net windows 
form application if you would like to do this before transering the roms.
